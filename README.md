This is a repository containing code and data for our master thesis at EPL, which aims to apply machine learning to fmri data.
We use python notebooks to manipulate and decode the data.

The master file is the master_script notebook.
The 3D beta-maps or t-maps are currently supposed to be in a "brain_maps" folder.
The masks are currently supposed to be in an untracked "masks" folder.
The outputs will be written to files in the "out" folder
The exact filenames needed as inputs can be changed in the master_script notebook.
